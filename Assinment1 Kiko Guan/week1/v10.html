    <h1>A Day</h1>
    <br />
    <h2>Emily Dickinson</h2>
    <h3>1830-1886</h3>

<p>I’ll tell you how the sun rose, — <br> A ribbon at a time.  <br>The <em>steeples swam in amethyst</em>,  <br>The news like squirrels ran.</p>
<p>The hills untied their bonnets,  <br>The bobolinks begun. <br> Then I said softly to myself,  <br>“That must have been the sun!”</p>
<p>But how he set, I know not.  <br>There seemed a purple stile  <br>Which little yellow boys and girls <br> Were climbing all the while</p>
<p>Till when they reached the other side, <br> A dominie in gray  <br>Put gently up the evening bars, <br> And led the flock away.
