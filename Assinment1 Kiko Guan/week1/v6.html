    <h1>A Day</h1>
    <h2>Emily Dickinson</h2>
    <h3>1830-1886</h3>
<p>I’ll <strong>tell</strong> you how the sun rose, —</p>
<p>A ribbon at a time.</p>
<p>The sttples swam in amethyst,</p>
<p>The news like squirrels ran.</p>
<p>The hills untied their bonnets, 
<p>The bobolinks begun.</p> <p>Then I said softly to myself,</p> 
 <p>“That must have been the sun!”</p>
<p>But how he set, I know not. </p>
<p>There seemed a purple stile</p>
<p> Which little yellow boys and girls</p>
<p> Were climbing all the while</p>
<p>Till when they reached the other side, </p>
<p>A dominie in gray</p>
 <p>Put gently up the evening bars, </p>
<p>And led the flock away.</p>
